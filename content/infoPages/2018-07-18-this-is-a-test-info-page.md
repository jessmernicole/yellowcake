I am Jessmer Nicole Norteza, a **freelance content writer** and a licensed professional teacher based in the Philippines. 

I have acquired a degree in Secondary English teaching and is still up for continuous learning and growth through post-graduate studies. Although I could have been in the field of education given my content and pedagogical acquisition through the years in the academe, my passion for writing has brought me here in this career path and with that, I have grown consistently stoked in developing my craft, to give unprecedented service to my clients.
