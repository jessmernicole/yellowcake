    I have lived with the sole desire of being able to channel my thoughts
    through my words. 

    Such far-fetched but is now redeemed through bravery and love.

    Here is where I started to dive into the realms of my capacities, of my
    fears set aside. 


    My haven, and where I always let loose.
